Language-Fortran problems to solve:

- CONTAINS must have whitespace before it
	(PreProcessor.hs will add whitespace)
	
- No SELECT CASE support
	(Added code to parse and represent select case statements)
	
- & operator
	(Limited support. Adequate for the needs of the project at the moment)

- .or. must have whitespace either side
	(PreProcessor.hs will add whitesapce)

- 7000 format(37e20.10) in module_timseris.f95
	(Limited support for format specifiers without the 'e'. Later review will perhaps be needed, however this does not hold up the project)

- Case mismatch between subroutine <name> and end subroutine <name>
	(Check in Parser.hs checks lowercase versions of subroutine names now)
