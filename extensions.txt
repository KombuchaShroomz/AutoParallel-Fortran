THINGS THAT LANGUAGE-FORTRAN CAN'T DEAL WITH:

- Contains
	It needs there to be whitepsace in front of contains
	
- Select case
	Does not have code to parse select case statements
	
- & operator

- .or. must have whitespace either side

- 7000 format(37e20.10) in module_timseris.f95

- Case mismatch between subroutine <name> and end subroutine <name>
